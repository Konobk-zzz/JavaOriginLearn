/**
 * Convenience class for writing character files.  The constructors of this
 * class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer
 * size are acceptable.  To specify these values yourself, construct an
 * OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream.
 * 方便课写字符文件。 该类的构造函数假定默认字符编码和默认字节缓冲区大小是可以接受的。
 * 要自己指定这些值，请在FileOutputStream上构造一个OutputStreamWriter。
 *
 * <p>Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the
 * underlying platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be
 * opened for writing by only one <tt>FileWriter</tt> (or other file-writing
 * object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in this class
 * will fail if the file involved is already open.
 * 文件是否可用或可能被创建取决于底层平台。 特别是某些平台允许一次只能打开一个文件来写入一个FileWriter （或其他文件写入对象）。
 * 在这种情况下，如果所涉及的文件已经打开，则此类中的构造函数将失败。
 *
 * <p><code>FileWriter</code> is meant for writing streams of characters.
 * For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a
 * <code>FileOutputStream</code>.
 * FileWriter是用于写入字符流。 要编写原始字节流，请考虑使用FileOutputStream 。
